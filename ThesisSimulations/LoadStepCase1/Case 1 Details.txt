Case 1:

The loads on the networks are static loads based on the exponential frequency-dependent load model.

The simulation starts with a loading that is well within the operational range of each DG. At t=2.0s we disturb the
network with load step at the respective buses.

Following are the load parameters:


Following are the inverter parameters:
