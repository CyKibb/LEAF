# LEAF: Low-Voltage Energy Aggregation Framework

LEAF is a flexible low-voltage framework that uses a component-based software architecture to allow for any user to create a digital twin of secondary distribution networks.  LEAF provides the user with advanced static (ZIP, Frequency Dependent, EPRI Loadsyn etc..) and dynamic (Exponential Recovery, Oscillatory Control and single-phase induction motor models) residential load models to accurately capture the behavior of the energy consumer at the grid-edge. Furthermore, LEAF provides the user with the capability to use advanced built-in generation models which accurately capture generation dynamics of inverter-based generation sources (battery storage systems, rooftop solar etcâ€¦) which are required to adhere to network interconnection standards. LEAF framework evaluates network dynamics against the modern interconnection standards to allow the user to adjust the design constraints of the DER to achieve maximal DER penetration, voltage stability and the ability for the secondary distribution network to disconnect from the broader power system to operate independently. 

The component-based architecture built into LEAF allows for the user to define any desired generation or load model specific to the requirements of the user to evaluate the low-voltage network against. Furthermore, the built-in architecture of LEAF provides the capability to interface the digital representation of the low-voltage network with real-time low-voltage network data to provide the user with the capability to predict network sensitivity for future events which may result in power outages as a result of instability.
