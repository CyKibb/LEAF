Case 4:

The Initial loads on the networks are static loads based on the exponential frequency-dependent load model.

We then disturb the system with a series of dynamic load steps consisting of the ERL Load

Loads in this case are similar to that of Case1 except with the sequence steps

Following are the load parameters:


Following are the inverter parameters:
